    "__Imagine a set of $N$ measurements $t_i$, with uncertainty variances $\\sigma_{ti}$, all of the same (unknown) quantity $T$. Assuming the generative model that each $t_i$ differs from T by a Gaussian-distributed offset, taken from a Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2_{ti}$, write down an expression for the log likelihood $\\ln\\mathcal L$ for the data given the model parameter T. Take a derivative and show that the maximum likelihood value for $T$ is the usual weighted mean.__"
